		<h2>Purpose:</h2>
		<p>
			- Guide for the incoming IT students.<br><br>

			<b>Explanation:</b><br> 
			Me personally as i began my journey in ICT strand way back Grade 11, i find it hard to cope with other students in IT strand because i didn't find any guides related to my strand. So i thought of this to help the future IT students and make IT easier for them.

			- Enhance a student's confident for his/her strand.<br><br>

		</p>

			<b>Explanation:</b><br> 
			Skills in reality and skills in programming is different, thats why i came up with an idea which will  ease the life of the future IT students by helping them enhancing their skills. This could be done by giving such programming activities and practices.
		</p>

		<p>
			- Enhances a student's way of socializing to his/her classmates.<br><br>
